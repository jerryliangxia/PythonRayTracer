I'd like to waive the three-day penalty for this assignment.

Additionally, I've added all files in the provided code under my submission as I've created .json and .obj files for use in my program.

Some additional points:
- For TorusMesh.json, I changed the path from "./meshes/torus.obj" to "../meshes/torus.obj"
- As well for the same file, I reduced the power of light3 from 10.0 to 1.0

### Images

Images are sorted into two directories `base` and `extra`.

For the novel scene, I created a separate scene that only contains AABB boxes to show that they work. However the main scene to evaluate is `NovelScene.png`.

I'd like to waive the three-day penalty for this assignment.

- For TorusMesh.json, I changed the path from "./meshes/torus.obj" to "../meshes/torus.obj"
- As well for the same file, I reduced the power of light3 from 10.0 to 1.0

### Images

Images are sorted into two directories `base` and `extra`.

For the novel scene, I created a separate scene that only contains AABB boxes to show that they work. However the main scene to evaluate is `NovelScene.png`.

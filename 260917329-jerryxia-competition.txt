Title: Building Blocks in Space

Technical Achievements:

- Mirroring (middle sphere)
- Refraction (two spheres in foreground)
- Soft shadows (three red spheres)
- Depth of field blur with aperture=0.25 and focus distance=10
- Motion blur (blue sphere) from 5 samples
- Quadrics (hyperboloid in the background)

Artistic Motivations:

I wanted to create complexity primarily through technical features by working with the medium of a simple scene. 

I used basic 3D objects to act as “building blocks” on the many ways the objects can be manipulated or built upon. 

As a result, I was able to show a range of details, encompassing depth of field blur, motion blur, and the geometric complexity of quadrics.
